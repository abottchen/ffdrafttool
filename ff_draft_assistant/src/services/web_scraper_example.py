"""
Additional considerations for real implementation:

1. Dynamic content handling:
   - Some sites load rankings via JavaScript
   - May need to find and call JSON APIs directly
   - Or use tools like Playwright for browser automation

2. Rate limiting and politeness:
   - Add delays between requests
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Use caching to avoid repeated requests

3. Data normalization:
   - Player names might vary between sites
   - Team abbreviations need standardization
   - Handle special characters and nicknames

4. Error handling:
   - Sites change their HTML structure
   - Handle missing data gracefully
   - Log scraping failures for monitoring

5. Legal considerations:
   - Check terms of service
   - Use data responsibly
   - Consider official APIs if available
