# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides fantasy football data to any MCP client for intelligent draft assistance. This server follows a **data-only architecture** - it retrieves and caches data from various sources, while the MCP client performs all analysis and recommendations.

## Architecture Overview

This MCP server implements a clean separation of concerns:
- **MCP Server (this repository)**: Provides raw data through 5 simple tools
- **MCP Client (e.g., Claude, GPT, etc.)**: Performs all analysis, strategy, and recommendations

## Supported Draft Formats

The server supports multiple Google Sheets draft formats through a pluggable parser architecture:

- **Dan Format**: Snake draft with team abbreviations in player names (`"Josh Allen BUF"`)
- **Adam Format**: Auction draft with "Last, First" names and team lookup (`"Hall, Breece"`)

Switch between formats by updating the `draft.format` setting in your configuration.

## Features

- **Multi-source player rankings** - Retrieves data from FantasySharks web scraping
- **Real-time draft tracking** - Reads draft progress from Google Sheets
- **Player information search** - Finds specific players by name, team, or position
- **Available players filtering** - Lists undrafted players at each position
- **Efficient caching** - In-memory caching for optimal performance
- **Simple data models** - Lightweight, focused data structures

## Data Sources

The server currently retrieves data from:
- **FantasySharks**: Player rankings via web scraping (no API key required)
- **Google Sheets**: Live draft tracking data (requires Google API credentials)

Future versions may add additional sources like ESPN, Yahoo, and FantasyPros.

## Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd fantasy-football-draft-assistant
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2. **Configure the application**:
   ```bash
   cp config.json.example config.json
   ```
   Edit `config.json` with your settings:
   - `google_sheets.default_sheet_id`: Your Google Sheet ID for draft tracking
   - `draft.format`: Set to "dan" for snake drafts or "adam" for auction drafts
   - `draft.owner_name`: Your name as it appears in the draft data
   - Configure sheet ranges for each format in `draft.formats` section
   - Cache settings can be left as defaults

3. **Set up Google Sheets API** (for draft tracking):
   - Create credentials at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Download `credentials.json` to the project directory
   - Run the authentication flow when first using Google Sheets features

   **Optional environment variables:**
   - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`: Custom path to credentials.json (defaults to project root)
   - `GOOGLE_TOKEN_FILE`: Custom path to token.json (defaults to project root)

## ðŸ¤– Using with MCP Clients

This server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. For LLM-based clients (Claude, GPT, etc.), we provide an example prompt configuration in `example-prompt.md` that enables the client to:
- Analyze player value and rankings
- Generate draft recommendations based on team needs
- Consider positional scarcity and bye weeks
- Provide personalized advice based on draft strategy

### For Claude Code Users
Copy `example-prompt.md` to your project root as `CLAUDE.md` to enable intelligent draft analysis.

### For Other MCP Clients
Adapt the prompt in `example-prompt.md` to your client's configuration format. The prompt contains domain knowledge about fantasy football strategy that helps LLMs provide better recommendations.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

## Available MCP Tools

The server provides 5 data-retrieval tools. All analysis and recommendations are performed by the MCP client.

### 1. `get_player_rankings`
Retrieves player rankings from FantasySharks with caching.

**Parameters:**
- `position_filter` (optional): Filter by position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST, or null for all)
- `force_refresh` (default: false): Bypass cache and fetch fresh data

**Returns:** List of players with rankings and basic information

### 2. `read_draft_progress`
Reads current draft state from Google Sheets with format-aware parsing.

**Parameters:**
- `force_refresh` (default: false): Ignore cache and fetch fresh data

**Returns:** Draft state with picks made and team rosters

**Note:** Sheet ID and range are automatically determined from configuration based on the selected draft format. The parser automatically handles both Dan format (snake draft) and Adam format (auction draft) based on your `draft.format` setting.

### 3. `get_available_players`
Lists top undrafted players at a specific position.

**Parameters:**
- `position` (required): Position to filter (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST)
- `limit` (default: 10): Maximum number of players to return

**Returns:** List of available players at the specified position

**Note:** This tool automatically fetches current draft state internally with caching.

### 4. `get_team_roster`
Gets all drafted players for a specific owner.

**Parameters:**
- `owner_name` (required): Name of the team owner as it appears in draft data

**Returns:** List of Player objects for that owner's team

**Note:** This tool warms the draft state cache and should typically be called first for personalized recommendations.

### 5. `get_player_info`
Searches for specific players by name.

**Parameters:**
- `last_name` (required): Player's last name (handles partial matches)
- `first_name` (optional): Player's first name to narrow results
- `team` (optional): Team abbreviation filter
- `position` (optional): Position filter

**Returns:** Matching players with their information

## Usage Examples

When used with an LLM-based MCP client configured with the example prompt, you can ask questions like:

### Draft Assistance
```
"Who should I draft next?"
"Show me the best available running backs"
"What positions does my team still need?"
"Tell me about Patrick Mahomes"
```

### How It Works

1. **You ask your MCP client** for draft advice
2. **The MCP client calls server tools** to get data:
   - `read_draft_progress` to get current draft state and picks (format-aware)
   - `get_team_roster` to see your current team composition
   - `get_available_players` to see undrafted players by position
   - `get_player_rankings` to get comprehensive player data
   - `get_player_info` to look up specific players
3. **The MCP client analyzes** the data considering:
   - Your roster needs
   - Positional scarcity
   - Player value and rankings
   - Bye week conflicts
4. **The MCP client provides** intelligent recommendations

## Performance Features

- **In-memory caching** for player rankings (reduces web scraping)
- **Draft state caching** with TTL (avoids redundant Google Sheets reads)  
- **Simplified data models** (minimal data transfer)
- **Fast response times** (data-only, no complex analysis)

## Design Philosophy

This MCP server follows the principle of **separation of concerns**:

1. **Data Layer (MCP Server)**: Focuses solely on data retrieval and caching
2. **Analysis Layer (MCP Client)**: Performs all intelligent analysis and recommendations
3. **Simplified Models**: Uses Pydantic models for type safety and validation
4. **Clean Architecture**: Web scrapers directly create domain models without conversion

This design makes the server:
- **Client-agnostic**: Works with any MCP-compatible client
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between data and logic
- **Testable**: Simple interfaces with predictable outputs
- **Efficient**: Minimal data transfer and processing

The example prompt (`example-prompt.md`) provides domain knowledge that enables LLM-based clients to deliver sophisticated fantasy football analysis.
