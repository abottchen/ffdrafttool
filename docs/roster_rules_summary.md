# Fantasy Football Roster Rules Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented comprehensive fantasy football roster construction rules using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The system is specifically designed for **draft assistance**, focusing on roster legality validation, position needs identification, and intelligent draft strategy recommendations.

## Key Components

### 1. RosterRules Class

**Purpose**: Enforces fantasy football roster construction rules and validates lineup/roster legality.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Position Requirements**: Tracks starter requirements (1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 K, 1 DST)
- ✅ **Roster Limits**: Maximum players per position (4 QB, 8 RB, 8 WR, 4 TE, 3 K, 3 DST)
- ✅ **FLEX Eligibility**: Identifies which players can fill FLEX (RB/WR/TE only)
- ✅ **Roster Legality**: Validates draft roster construction within limits
- ✅ **Roster Size Limits**: Enforces maximum roster size (19 players = 9 starters + 10 bench) 
- ✅ **Position Needs Calculation**: Identifies what positions a team still needs
- ✅ **Draft Validation**: Ensures draft picks comply with roster rules

**Note**: The system is designed for **draft assistance**, not lineup management. Starting lineup validation is handled separately during the season.

### 2. Enhanced Position Enum

**New Positions Added**:
- `FLEX`: Flexible position for RB/WR/TE
- `BE`: Bench designation
- `IR`: Injured Reserve designation

### 3. Updated TeamAnalysis Class

**Integration with RosterRules**:
- ✅ **Smart Roster Analysis**: Uses RosterRules for accurate position needs assessment
- ✅ **FLEX Depth Consideration**: Understands concepts like "need RB depth for FLEX spot"
- ✅ **Position Limit Awareness**: Knows when you're "at QB limit, focus on other positions"
- ✅ **Draft Strategy Advice**: Provides context-aware recommendations based on roster rules
- ✅ **Bye Week Analysis**: Considers roster construction in bye week planning

## Core Functionality

### Roster Legality Validation

```python
# Check if draft roster is legal
team = Team("My Team", 1)
# ... add drafted players to team ...

result = rules.is_roster_legal(team)
# Returns ValidationResult with violations if any limits exceeded
if not result.is_valid:
    print("Roster violations:", result.violations)
```

### Position Needs Analysis

```python
needs = rules.get_position_needs(team, consider_flex_depth=True)
# Returns: {Position.QB: 0, Position.RB: 1, Position.FLEX: 1, ...}
```

### FLEX Eligibility Calculation

```python
eligibility = rules.calculate_flex_eligibility(team)
print(f"FLEX options: {eligibility.total_flex_options}")
print(f"Best FLEX choice: {eligibility.best_flex_option.name}")
```

### Draft Strategy Advice

```python
analysis = TeamAnalysis(roster_rules=rules)
advice = analysis.get_draft_strategy_advice(team, available_players, round=5, total_rounds=15)

# Returns comprehensive advice:
{
    "primary_needs": ["Need 1 more WR for starting lineup"],
    "warnings": ["Close to QB roster limit (1 slot remaining)"],
    "opportunities": ["Need RB/WR/TE depth for FLEX position"],
    "flex_analysis": {"total_flex_options": 4, "rb_depth": 2, ...},
    "strategy_notes": ["Middle rounds: complete starting lineup and add key depth"]
}
```

## Test Coverage

**66 Comprehensive Tests** covering:

### RosterRules Tests (19 tests)  
- ✅ Initialization and configuration
- ✅ Roster legality checking (position limits, total size)
- ✅ Position needs calculation
- ✅ FLEX eligibility analysis  
- ✅ Position limits enforcement
- ✅ Edge cases (exactly at limits, invalid configurations)
- ❌ ~~Lineup validation~~ (removed - not needed for draft)

### TeamAnalysis Tests (10 tests)
- ✅ Roster needs analysis with RosterRules integration
- ✅ Position scarcity calculation
- ✅ Pick value evaluation with roster considerations
- ✅ Recommended positions based on needs and scarcity

### Draft Strategy Tests (9 tests)
- ✅ Early/mid/late round strategy advice
- ✅ Position limit warnings
- ✅ FLEX depth analysis
- ✅ Bye week conflict detection
- ✅ QB urgency warnings
- ✅ Round-specific recommendations

## Real-World Applications

### Draft Assistant Scenarios

1. **"You need RB depth for your FLEX spot"**
   - System detects insufficient FLEX-eligible players
   - Recommends drafting RB/WR/TE for flexibility

2. **"You're at the QB limit, focus on other positions"**
   - Warns when approaching position limits
   - Prevents roster construction mistakes

3. **"Time to draft Kicker and Defense"**
   - Recognizes late-round mandatory picks
   - Ensures roster completion

4. **"Heavy bye week conflicts in week 13"**
   - Analyzes bye week distributions
   - Warns about problematic scheduling

### League Customization

```python
# Custom league rules (e.g., Superflex)
custom_rules = RosterRules(
    starter_requirements={
        Position.QB: 2,  # Superflex
        Position.RB: 2,
        Position.WR: 3,  # 3 WR league
        Position.TE: 1,
        Position.FLEX: 1,
        Position.K: 1,
        Position.DST: 1,
    },
    roster_limits={Position.QB: 6, ...}  # Higher QB limit
)
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Clean Separation of Concerns
- **RosterRules**: Pure rule enforcement and validation
- **TeamAnalysis**: Strategic analysis using rules
- **Player/Team Models**: Data representation

### Dependency Injection
- TeamAnalysis accepts RosterRules for testability
- Easy to swap different league configurations

### Comprehensive Validation
- Multiple layers: lineup validation, roster validation, draft validation
- Clear error messages and warnings

### Strategic Intelligence
- Context-aware advice based on draft round, team needs, and league rules
- Balances immediate needs with long-term roster construction

## Next Steps

The roster rules system is now ready for integration with:

1. **MCP Tools**: Draft pick suggestions using intelligent analysis
2. **Google Sheets**: Real-time roster tracking and validation
3. **Web Scraping**: Player data integration with roster constraints
4. **User Interface**: Clear presentation of roster needs and strategy advice

The TDD approach ensures reliability and makes future enhancements straightforward while maintaining backward compatibility.
